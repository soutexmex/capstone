        <p><i>The prescription drug I'm interested in is not in the database</i>  
        </br>
        </br>
        <b>Send the webmaster an email on the contact page and it will be added. No doubt other people will want that
        information as well</b></P>
        </br>
        <p><i>Why a prescription feedback database?</i>  
        </br>
        </br>
        <b>There are plenty of drug databases out on the Internet but none dedicated solely to experiences and opinions</b></P>
        </br>
        <p><i>Why keep comment posters anonymous?</i>  
        </br>
        </br>
        <b>It encourages posts as opposed to going through a process of creating an account for something you may only
            participate in one time</b></P>
        </br>
        <p><i>Does anonymous posting just encourage flame wars?</i>  
        </br>
        </br>
        <b>The website is monitored; any inflammatory, foul language, advertisements, spam gets deleted</b></P>
        </br> 
        <p><i>Will you use my opinion for financial gain?</i>  
        </br>
        </br>
        <b>If there is a way to monetize your opinion, please let me know =)</b></P>
        </br> 
        <p><i>How can I edit my comment?</i>  
        </br>
        </br>
        <b>You can't. But you can post another comment. No editing helps keep those ubiquitous Internet trolls in-check</b></P>
        </br> 
        <p><i>Will you use my information to sell to a third party?</i>  
        </br>
        </br>
        <b>There is no information other than your opinion on a drug, which is why this is an anonymous posting website</b></P>
        </br>
        <p><i>No, seriously, you cheeky bugger, is this website legit?</i>
        </br>
        </br>
        <b>This website began as my Java capstone project in community college and I thought, why not make it beneficial to 
            people globally? All it costs me is $10/month in hosting fees and my coding labor, which is free. I'd like to think I can afford to 
            help out humanity connect to each other for that mere pittance, especially considering people are always looking for
            an objective opinion on a prescribed drug, something not being driven by self-interests, i.e., a pharmaceutical 
            marketing department or the physicians on their payroll</b></P>
        </br>
        <p><i>What's in it for you?</i>
        </br>
        </br>
        <b>Other than altruistic intentions, I have a website to add to my portfolio that shows I can connect both client side 
            and server side together. You can get an 8-year-old to create a website but an 8-year-old generally cannot 
            understand secured database connection concepts and writing said protocols</b></p>
